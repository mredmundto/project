This is the final project checklist: 

A project README.md that explains your project
What does your project do?
Answer: 

How to set it up
Answer: 

Run a local development server
Answer: 
 
Your project should be a truffle project
Answer: - yes, from petshop base

All of your contracts should be in a contracts directory
Truffle compile should successfully compile contracts
Answer: Yes - can compile

Migration contract and migration scripts should work
Truffle migrate should successfully migrate contracts to a locally running ganache-cli test blockchain on port 8545
Answer: need to run a local blockchain - to be done on Saturday

All tests should be in a tests directory
Running truffle test should migrate contracts and run your tests
Answer: NOT YET 
 
Smart Contract code should be commented according to the specs in the documentation
Answer: 
 
Create at least 5 tests for each smart contract
Write a sentence or two explaining what the tests are covering, and explain why you wrote those tests
Answer: 
 
A development server to serve the front end interface of the application

Answer: AFTER this Saturday

A document called avoiding_common_attacks.md that explains what measures you took to ensure that your contracts are not susceptible to common attacks. (Module 9 Lesson 3)
Answer: AFTER this Saturday 
 
Implement a library or an EthPM package in your project
If your project does not require a library or an EthPM package, demonstrate how you would do that in a contract called LibraryDemo.sol
